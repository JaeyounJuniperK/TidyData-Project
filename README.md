# Tidy Data Project
The notebook aims to demonstrate how to import, tidy, and visualize data from the [**2008 Summer Olympic Games**](https://edjnet.github.io/OlympicsGoNUTS/2008/). It walks through the process of reshaping the original dataset (which is in a wide format) into a long format that adheres to the principles of tidy data. This transformation makes the data easier to filter, group, and analyze. 

**What is Tidy Data**
Tidy data is a way of organizing data that makes it easier to analyze and visualize. It follows a specific structure that is consistent and predictable, making data manipulation more straightforward. Tidy data is important because it makes data analysis and visualization more efficient and intuitive. Reference: [**Tidy Data**](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)

*Tidy Data Principles*
Tidy data adheres to the following core principles:
- Each variable forms a column.
- Each observation forms a row.
- Each type of observational unit forms a table.
By organizing the data in this way, we achieve a standardized and consistent format that simplifies analysis and visualization.

**Instructions:**
*Prerequisites:*
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebook:
- Python 3.12.7
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
(To install these libraries, use pip: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn)

*Running the Notebook*
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/Tidydata-Project.git
- Navigate to the project directory: cd Tidydata-Project
- Launch Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook
- Open the notebook file (TidyData-Project.ipynb) and run the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset used in this project is the 2008 Beijing Olympics Medalists Dataset. It contains information about athletes, sports categories, gender, and medals awarded. The data underwent cleaning and transformation to ensure compliance with tidy data principles.
